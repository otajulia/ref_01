- line 14: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that insufficient physical activity is associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and increased mortality [1-4]. While physical activity is essential for maintaining individual health, it also serves as a critical factor in reducing healthcare expenditure at the population level [5-7]. In Republic of Korea, the rapid increase in healthcare spending is driven by population ageing and the rising burden of chronic diseases, placing growing pressure on national health budgets. Accordingly, identifying strategies that simultaneously promote physical fitness and mitigate medical expenditures has become an urgent public health priority.
- line 15: Physical fitness, especially cardiorespiratory fitness, is often regarded as a clinical vital sign of health [9-11]. While physical activity represents energy-consuming movements, physical fitness constitutes the resultant capacity developed through these activities. Despite national efforts, overall fitness levels among Korean adults remain low, with a rapid decline observed in the elderly. Data from the National Fitness Award100 (NFA100), a nationwide government initiative that evaluates and prescribes individualized exercise programs, indicate that overall fitness levels among adults and older adults remain low, with a particularly rapid decline observed in the elderly [33,34]. This deterioration raises concerns that declining fitness may further accelerate healthcare cost growth.
- line 16: Previous research has predominantly focused on the association between single fitness components, such as cardiorespiratory fitness or handgrip strength, and medical costs [12-19]. However, these fragmented approaches often fail to capture the holistic nature of physical health. There is a notable lack of evidence regarding how comprehensive fitness profiles integrating both health-related and skill-based attributes relate to actual administrative healthcare utilization at a national scale.
- line 17: To address this gap, the South Korean government implemented the NFA100, a nationwide initiative providing standardized, scientific evaluations of various fitness domains [33,34]. While the NFA100 serves as a key infrastructure for health promotion, its direct economic implications have not been fully elucidated through large-scale administrative data. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between comprehensive physical fitness tiers and annual healthcare expenditures by linking the NFA100 database with the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims data at a national scale for the first time [30-32]. By clarifying the economic implications of maintaining physical fitness, this research provides essential empirical evidence for population-level health promotion and the development of evidence-based public health policies.
- line 20: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using linked data from the National Fitness Award 100 (NFA100) and the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database from 2015 to 2022. The NFA100 is a government-led program that systematically assesses health-related and skill-related fitness components using standardized protocols [33,34]. The NHIS database is a nationwide administrative repository that captures healthcare utilization and reimbursed expenditures for nearly the entire population of the Republic of Korea [30-32]. Linking these large-scale datasets enabled a comprehensive examination of the association between objectively measured fitness levels and subsequent healthcare expenditures, minimizing biases related to self-reported measures and incomplete medical records.
- line 22: Individual-level linkage between the NFA100 and NHIS datasets was executed using unique, de-identified personal identifiers under the strict supervision of both institutions to ensure data privacy. The initial study population comprised adults aged ??9 years who completed baseline fitness testing between 2015 and 2022. To maintain data integrity, participants with incomplete fitness profiles or missing medical cost information were systematically excluded. For analytical precision, the cohort was stratified into two distinct age groups, adults (19??4 years) and older adults (??5 years). This stratification is essential because the NFA100 employs different standardized assessment protocols tailored to the physiological characteristics of each age group [33,34]. The integration of the NFA100 with the NHIS claims database empowers a comprehensive examination of the association between objective fitness and healthcare expenditure [30-32]. By leveraging these validated national repositories, this study minimizes potential biases inherent in self-reported measures or fragmented medical records.
- line 24: To determine these grades, the NFA100 utilizes a battery of standardized tests tailored to each age group [33,34]. For adults, health-related fitness was assessed through body mass index (body composition), 20m shuttle run (cardiorespiratory endurance), handgrip strength (muscular strength), curl-up (muscular endurance), and sit-and-reach (flexibility). Skill-related fitness was evaluated using standing long jump (power) and 10m shuttle run (agility). For older adults, functional fitness components included the 6-minute walk test, 30-second chair stand, and the timed up-and-go (TUG) test, reflecting their specific physiological needs [19-23].
- line 27: The primary outcome was total annual healthcare expenditure, defined as the aggregate sum of both inpatient and outpatient medical costs. Annual healthcare expenditure was defined as the total reimbursed costs accrued during the 12 months following the index date (from the day after the NFA100 assessment). These data were extracted from the NHIS claims database, representing the most comprehensive record of direct medical spending in Korea [30-32]. Total healthcare expenditures were normalized to 2022 Korean Won (KRW) using the medical care Consumer Price Index (CPI) for medical care [Kosis], and subsequently converted to US Dollars (USD) based on the average 2022 exchange rate (1 USD = 1,291.95 KRW). To account for the characteristic right-skewed distribution of medical cost data, total expenditures were modeled using methods appropriate for skewed cost outcomes [29].
- line 30: Furthermore, we identified baseline comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes from the claims data. These specific covariates were selected based on their established associations with both physical fitness levels and healthcare utilization in previous literature [17,27,28]. By mitigating these confounding effects, the study ensures a more robust evaluation of the direct relationship between objective fitness tiers and medical spending.
- line 34: To estimate the marginal effect of fitness levels on annual healthcare expenditures, we employed Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with a gamma distribution and log link function, which effectively accounts for the right-skewed nature of medical cost data [29]. Because the gamma model requires strictly positive costs, we verified that the proportion of zero annual healthcare expenditures was low (< %) and restricted the analysis to participants with positive expenditures; model-based estimates were than back-transformed and reported on the original currency scale (KRW) for interpretation. To identify demographic-specific patterns, the analysis was stratified by age group (Adults vs. Seniors) and further by sex (Male vs. Female). All reported estimates in the regression models were fully adjusted for a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including age, sex (in combined models), income deciles, residential region, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity (meeting physical activity guidelines), medical history (ICD-10-based comorbidities), and family history.
- line 61: This study identifies a significant and independent association between objectively measured physical fitness and annual healthcare expenditures using a large-scale, population-based linked dataset from the Republic of Korea. Our findings elucidate a clear inverse dose-response relationship, where higher fitness tiers consistently correspond to reduced healthcare expenditures. Notably, the economic implications of fitness were particularly pronounced in the senior population. These results align with previous research indicating that physical inactivity is associated with higher healthcare utilization and expenditure [6,7,15]. However, while earlier studies frequently relied on self-reported activity, our use of objective fitness metrics provides more granular and empirical evidence regarding the economic value of physiological capacity.
- line 62: In the senior group, the substantial expenditure disparity observed in functional mobility assessments, specifically the 3-m up-and-go and Figure 8 walk, is particularly noteworthy. These results align with frailty and functional reserve frameworks, which posit that when physical capacity falls below a critical level, the risk of catastrophic health events and subsequent medical utilization increases disproportionately [26-28]. Our findings also resonate with prior work showing that impaired functional capacity, such as shorter 6-minute walk distance and slower mobility performance, predicts adverse outcomes in older adults [20-22]. The fact that seniors in the participation-only group incurred over $400 more in annual expenditures than those in Tier 1 underscores that impaired mobility is not merely a clinical concern but a primary driver of geriatric healthcare expenditures.
- line 63: Furthermore, our component-specific analysis revealed that muscular strength, as measured by handgrip strength, is a potent predictor of healthcare expenditures even within the adult population. This finding aligns with a growing body of literature, most notably the PURE study, which identified grip strength as a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and hospital admission [16,17]. Recent population-level evidence has also confirmed that lower handgrip strength and poorer TUG performance are associated with increased hospitalization costs [18]. The significant expenditure increase among adults with low grip strength in our study suggests that muscular fitness may function as a physiological buffer. Such physiological resilience may facilitate more rapid recovery from acute illnesses and reduce the requirement for intensive medical interventions, thereby mitigating the overall economic burden on the healthcare system.
- line 64: Several mechanisms may explain the observed association between high fitness and lower costs. High fitness is strongly correlated with improved metabolic profiles and lower chronic disease burden [1-4]. Beyond disease prevention, fit individuals often exhibit greater physiological resilience. As described in the frailty literature, individuals with higher physical reserves are better equipped to maintain homeostasis when faced with external stressors, thereby avoiding cascading medical expenses associated with frailty and multimorbidity [26-28].
- line 65: A particularly compelling finding of this study is that skill-based fitness components, specifically agility, balance, and coordination, demonstrated predictive power for healthcare expenditures that was comparable, and in some instances superior, to traditional health-related fitness markers. While muscular strength and aerobic capacity are well-established indicators of metabolic health, our data reveal that tasks requiring complex neuromuscular control, such as the 3-m up-and-go and Figure 8 walk, are more acutely sensitive to the economic burden of aging. This interpretation is consistent with evidence linking functional mobility deficits to hospitalization and fall-related burden in older adults [18,24,25].
- line 67: The economic significance of these markers can be largely explained by their direct link to fall-related injuries, which represent some of the most costly medical events for the elderly and frequently necessitate emergency interventions and long-term rehabilitation [25]. In this context, agility and balance serve as a primary safety net that preempts these high-cost incidents. This aligns with findings from fall-prevention evidence syntheses emphasizing the importance of balance-focused exercise in reducing falls [24]. By identifying skill-based fitness as a potent economic predictor, our study underscores the urgent need for public health initiatives like NFA100 to evolve beyond conventional walking programs and prioritize multimodal neuromotor training.
- line 69: Ultimately, the NFA100 functions as a vital public health infrastructure rather than a mere sports event. The significant cost disparity observed across tiers demonstrates that objective fitness certification, not just participation, is essential for economic benefits. By improving fitness levels, the NFA100 may simultaneously extend healthy life expectancy and support fiscal sustainability of the national health insurance system [6,7,30-34].
- line 81: This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [35] and received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Korea Institute of Sport Science (IRB No. XXXX). To ensure data privacy and confidentiality, all datasets were fully anonymized by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) prior to being provided for analysis. The requirement for informed consent was waived by the IRB as the study utilized secondary, de-identified administrative data that posed no more than minimal risk to the participants. [NHIS No.xxx]
